# GlucoProgs
Programs that should help diabetic people

# GlucoMan
Will be a Glucose Manager program for diabetic persons.  
Currently it makes just a few calculations, but very useful to the diabetic person that has to make carbohydrate count.  
I will expand the program in the future, including full management of insulin, carboihydrates, and possibly foods.  
Distribution will be at: https://ingmonti.it/GlucoMan/ source at https://github.com/gamondue/GlucoProgs (it wil have also a binary distribution)

The first functionalities I implemented are those enabled in the buttons of the program.";
