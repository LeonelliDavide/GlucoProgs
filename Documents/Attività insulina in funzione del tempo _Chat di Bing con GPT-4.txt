can you recover a table of insulin various drugs typical duration?

Certainly! Here is a table of various types of insulin and their typical duration 1:

Tabella

Type of Insulin	Onset of Action	Peak Effect	Duration of Action
Rapid-acting	15 minutes	1-2 hours	2-4 hours
Short-acting	30 minutes	2-3 hours	3-6 hours
Intermediate-acting	2-4 hours	4-12 hours	12-18 hours
Long-acting	1-2 hours	No peak effect	24+ hours

can you specify the duration of single specific drugs?
Rapid-acting insulin: Takes about 15 minutes to start working, peaks in 1-2 hours, and lasts for 2-4 hours.
Short-acting insulin: Takes about 30 minutes to start working, peaks in 2-3 hours, and lasts for 3-6 hours.
Intermediate-acting insulin: Takes about 2-4 hours to start working, peaks in 4-12 hours, and lasts for 12-18 hours.
Long-acting insulin: Takes about 1-2 hours to start working, has no peak effect, and lasts for 24+ hours.
I hope this helps

Are there around any graphs regading insulin action during time?
Yes, there are many graphs available online that illustrate the action of insulin over time. Here are some examples:

UpToDate provides a detailed article on insulin action, which includes a graph of insulin signaling pathways 1.

Accu-Chek offers an insulin effect graph that displays blood glucose levels against insulin and carbohydrates 2.
Verywell Health has a chart that covers different brands of insulin, their onset of action, peak effect, and duration of action 3.

MSD Manuals provides a table of onset, peak, and duration of action of human insulin preparations 4.

Healthline has a chart that compares different types of insulin, including rapid-acting, regular- or short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting 5.

Is there a mathematical curve with which best fit these insulin acting curves?

Yes, there are mathematical models that can be used to fit insulin action curves. One such model is the minimal model of glucose regulation 1. This model allows the estimation of insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and hepatic insulin extraction from an oral glucose test. Another study used a differential-equations based model to describe the coupled dynamics of glycerol concentrations and insulin action during an oral glucose tolerance test in female adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance 2. The study found that the action of insulin on glycerol peaks approximately 67 minutes earlier and follows the dynamics of plasma insulin more closely compared to insulin action on glucose. These findings suggest that the dynamics of insulin action show tissue-specific differences in our insulin-resistant adolescent population, with adipose tissue responding to insulin more quickly compared to muscle and liver.

I don't need to find the metabolic reaction of the body, I am just lookin for a formula to express the effect of various types of insulin drugs over time

However, I am not aware of any formula that can be used to express the effect of various types of insulin drugs over time. The duration of insulin action is influenced by several factors, including the type of insulin, the dose, the injection site, and individual patient characteristics. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a single formula that accurately describes the effect of insulin over time.
